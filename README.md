St Joseph's RC High School is a high school that houses all its learners in hostels.
One for the boys and another for the girls. As a former learner at this amazing school
I designed this API with my experience in the boy's hostel in mind.<br><br>There are
two main actors in the hostel, mainly learners and supervisors or matrons, of which there
are two, one for senior learners (grades 10 - 12) and another for junior learners (grades 9 - 8).
Each grade has their own **block** or dorm, with grades 11 and 12, sharing the same **block**.

## Main API Functionalities

The API was designed to take care of the most common hostel management activities carried out by the supervisors
which are:

- Taking attendance for daily evening study sessions, and afternoon sessions on Sundays
- Taking attendance for lunch and breakfast meals on Saturdays and Sundays
- Taking church attendance on a set weekday for each group of learners and Sundays for all learners
- Assigning and taking attendance for hostel duties to learners

## Additional API Functionalities

- Viewing learner attendance history e.g church attendance history
